# Wildlife-Simulator
This project was done as part of my final year of University. The goal of the assignment was to produce a prototype for a game that targeted key audiences for the purposes of education.

Wildlife-Simulator.7z contains the Unreal Project (which requires Unreal Engine 4.24.3) while WindowsNoEditor.7z contains an executable which does not require Unreal to run.
